### Summary of what i gained
From this talk, I learned that computer science is not only about coding, but it also involves proper planning through the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), requirement gathering, and system design before starting development. The speaker explained that good project management is important to control chaos, manage time and budget, and improve teamwork synergy during system development. I also gained a better understanding of project management methodologies such as Waterfall and Agile, where Waterfall is structured and sequential while Agile is flexible and focuses on continuous improvement. Overall, this talk increased my awareness of the skills needed in the industry, such as Agile working practices, system architecture focus, and AI-assisted development, and it motivated me to improve my technical and teamwork skills for future projects.

### Suggestion for improvement
One improvement to the talk is to provide more real-world examples and case studies so that students can better understand how project management and system development concepts are applied in actual industry projects.
