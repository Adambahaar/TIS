## Project Design Thinking : UTM Smart Cafeteria

---

### Summary of what i gained 
Working on the UTM Smart Cafeteria project taught me a lot about how technology can truly make life easier for people. I realized that solving real problems isn’t just about being creative, it’s about really listening to users and understanding their struggles, like long queues, limited seats, and confusing menus. Designing the prototype and testing it with students showed me the value of teamwork, communication, and turning ideas into solutions that actually help people. This experience inspired me to keep improving my technical skills and think more critically about user-centered design.

### Suggestion of improvement

For the next project , we will do more better and advance for example we put an AI in our project.
