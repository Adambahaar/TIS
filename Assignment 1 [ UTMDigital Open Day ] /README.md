# Reflection

## Industry talk & Industry Visit ( UTM Digital Open Day + Oracle Academy Talk )

### Summary of what i gained
From the UTM Digital Open Day and the Oracle Academy sharing session, I gained a clearer understanding of how the digital industry works in real life. I learned that technology is not just something we study in class, but it is applied in many areas such as digital systems, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and digital transformation.

### Suggestion for improvement 
One improvement I would suggest is to include more interactive sessions such as hands-on demonstrations or short workshops, so students can experience the technologies directly instead of only observing them.

### Conclusion 
This event helped me build confidence and curiosity about the digital world. It reminded me that learning is not only about getting good grades, but also about understanding how knowledge connects to real-life applications.
