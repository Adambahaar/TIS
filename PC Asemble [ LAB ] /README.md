## PC ASSEMBLE 

---

### Summary of what i gained
Assembling a PC was a valuable hands-on experience that helped me understand how computer components work together to create a functional system. Before this, I only knew the parts theoretically, but physically installing the CPU, RAM, motherboard, and connecting power cables taught me the importance of precision, patience, and organization. I faced challenges like managing cables neatly and troubleshooting initial boot issues, which improved my problem-solving skills.

### Suggestion for improvement
Include time to intentionally troubleshoot common issues so learners gain problem-solving experience.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, I feel more prepared to maintain, upgrade, or troubleshoot computers independently. This hands-on exposure will also support my future studies in technology-related fields, as it bridges the gap between theory and practical application.
